# Order Status Update Email System 📧

## Overview
Your JOOG e-commerce project now has a fully automated email system that sends emails to customers whenever their order status is updated.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Email Triggers ✅
- **Status Changes**: When an admin changes an order status in the Django admin or through the API, an email is automatically sent
- **No Manual Work**: The system works completely automatically - no need to manually send emails
- **Smart Detection**: Only sends emails when the status actually changes (prevents duplicate emails)

### 2. Supported Status Changes 📋
- **Pending → Confirmed**: "Order Confirmed" email
- **Confirmed → Shipped**: "Order Shipped" email  
- **Shipped → Delivered**: "Order Delivered" email
- **Any → Cancelled**: "Order Cancelled" email

### 3. Email Templates 🎨
The system uses professional HTML and text email templates:
- **HTML Template**: `templates/emails/order_status_update.html` (beautiful styled email)
- **Text Template**: `templates/emails/order_status_update.txt` (plain text fallback)
- **Smart Fallback**: If templates are missing, uses a simple text email

### 4. What Customers Receive 💌

#### Order Confirmed Email:
- ✅ Order confirmation notification
- 📦 What's next information
- 🚚 Estimated delivery time
- 📱 Link to track order

#### Order Shipped Email:
- 📦 Shipment notification
- 🔍 Tracking information available
- 📅 Expected delivery date
- 💯 Package in transit status

#### Order Delivered Email:
- 🎉 Delivery confirmation
- 💝 Thank you message
- ⭐ Request for review
- 🎯 Satisfaction follow-up

#### Order Cancelled Email:
- ❌ Cancellation notification
- 💰 Refund information
- 📞 Support contact details
- ❓ Help options

### 5. Technical Implementation 🔧

#### Django Signals
- Uses `pre_save` signal to detect status changes
- Automatically triggers emails when Order.status is modified
- Works with Django admin, API, and any code that saves Order objects

#### EmailService Class
Located in `orders/email_utils.py`:
```python
email_service = EmailService()
success, message = email_service.send_order_status_update_email(order, old_status, new_status)
```

#### Smart Context
Templates receive comprehensive context:
- Order details (number, amount, date, items)
- Customer information (name, email)
- Status information (old status, new status, display name)
- Company branding (logo, address, support email)
- Site URLs for order tracking

### 6. Email Features 🌟

#### Professional Design
- Color-coded by status (blue for confirmed, yellow for shipped, green for delivered, red for cancelled)
- Progress bar showing order journey
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Company branding integration

#### Reliable Delivery
- Error handling and logging
- Retry mechanism for failed emails
- Transaction-safe email sending
- Multiple email backends support

#### Comprehensive Logging
All email activities are logged to `logs/email.log`:
- Successful email sends
- Failed attempts with error details
- Retry attempts
- Status change tracking

### 7. Configuration ⚙️

#### Settings (in `settings.py`):
```python
# Email configuration
SEND_ORDER_EMAILS = True  # Enable/disable order emails
ORDER_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX = "[JOOG] "  # Email subject prefix
ORDER_EMAIL_FROM = "orders@joogwear.com"  # From email address

# Retry settings
RETRY_FAILED_EMAILS = True  # Enable email retry
EMAIL_RETRY_DELAY_HOURS = 2  # Retry delay
MAX_EMAIL_RETRIES = 3  # Maximum retry attempts
```

#### Template Variables:
- `{{ order }}` - Order object
- `{{ customer_name }}` - Customer's full name
- `{{ new_status }}` - New status code
- `{{ status_display }}` - Human-readable status
- `{{ site_name }}` - Your site name
- `{{ site_url }}` - Your website URL
- `{{ support_email }}` - Support email address

### 8. Testing the System 🧪

#### Test Script
Run the included test script:
```bash
python test_order_status_emails.py
```

#### Manual Testing
1. Go to Django admin
2. Open any order
3. Change the status field
4. Save the order
5. Check `logs/email.log` for email sending confirmation

#### Check Email Logs
```bash
tail -f logs/email.log
```

### 9. Troubleshooting 🔧

#### Common Issues:

**No Emails Sent?**
- Check `SEND_ORDER_EMAILS = True` in settings
- Verify SMTP configuration
- Check `logs/email.log` for errors

**Template Errors?**
- Ensure templates exist in `templates/emails/`
- Check template syntax
- System has fallback to simple text email

**Signal Not Working?**
- Verify `orders.apps.OrdersConfig` is in `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Check that `orders/apps.py` imports signals in `ready()` method
- Look for error messages in Django logs

### 10. Invoice Integration 📄

#### Automatic Invoice Emails
When status changes to 'confirmed', 'shipped', or 'delivered':
- Tax invoice is automatically generated (if not exists)
- Invoice PDF is attached to status update email
- Separate invoice email is also sent

### 11. Admin Integration 👨‍💼

#### Django Admin
- Change order status in admin interface
- Email is sent automatically upon save
- No additional steps required

#### API Integration
- Works with REST API status updates
- Compatible with custom admin interfaces
- Triggers on any Order.save() call

## System Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
